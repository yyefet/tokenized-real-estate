Invest in Real Estate Openly and Fully Transparent

# About this project
This project has been started to pool investments in real estate in a way
that has not been done before - on Github - in the most open and transparent
way possible.

The idea is to syndicate real estate investments online by anyone with a github.com
account and an Ethereum Crypto wallet.  The pool will vote on every aspect of the investment
including: which deals to get involved in, how the property is managed, how frequently to receive
payouts on rental income, and when to sell the property.

# How it works
* Deals will be identified, analyzed and voted on
* Investors will commit to an investment
* Option to purchase property will be submitted to seller
* Investors will have to commit capital via Ethereum Smart contract
* Once Capital requirements have been met, property will be purchased
* Property Manager will be selected
* Rental Income will be distributed

# Get Started
Since this is just a concept for the moment, *we URGE everyone interested to STAR and WATCH this repo*.
Once we hit 100+ watchers, we will start initiate the process of finding attractive properties.
